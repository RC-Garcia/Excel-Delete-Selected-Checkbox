# Excel-Delete-Selected-Checkbox
This macro will delete checkboxes in the selected cells. If a selected cell contains multiple checkboxes, it will delete all of them. Remember to save your workbook as a macro-enabled workbook (with a .xlsm extension) if you want to retain the macro functionality.

## How to Use?

   2. In the VBA editor, insert a new module:
     Right-click on any item in the project explorer.
     'Select Insert' -> ' Module '.
   3. Copy and paste the [VBA code](DeleteCBox.bcf) into the module.
   4. Close the VBA editor.
   5. To run the macro:
        Select the cells containing the checkboxes.
        Press Alt + F8 to open the "Macro" dialog.
